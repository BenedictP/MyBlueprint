# MyBlueprint

My personal blueprint to kickstart a new android project and to test out new features/architectures etc.
    
Every Module for clean architecture is created but not used. I prefer to delete or merge modules when starting a new project instead of creating new. So this example is a little architecture overkill (but intended).

## Interesting Branches:

- Migrated one Fragment to Jetpack Compose: https://github.com/BenedictP/MyBlueprint/tree/feature/migration-jetpack-compose
- Migrate whole app to Jetpack Compose: WIP
